/* A block is one mining output. It contains one or two transactions: a reward
 * transaction (paid to the miner's public key) and an optional normal
 * transaction (paid from one public key to any other). The reward transaction
 * must have all zeros as its prev_transaction_hash and src_signature. The
 * normal transaction, if unused, must have all zeros as its
 * prev_transaction_hash, dest_pubkey_hash, and src_signature.
 *
 * height is the height of this block in the blockchain. The root of the
 * blockchain (the "genesis block") must have height==0 and prev_block_hash all
 * zeros.
 *
 * nonce is the value that is tweaked until the hash of the block satisfies
 * TARGET_HASH. */
