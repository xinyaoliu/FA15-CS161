This README is my thoughts on this project.

I spent hours on the "encryption", but did nothing.

This is because of a lack of overview of the "encryption" function.

Look top-down is a better way to finish it, which gives me an 

MARCO view of what I should do in this project.

In the order: main.c -> rsa.c/ rsa.h.

Another thing, keep an eye on the rsa_ functions and how to safely 

use mpz_ fucntions.
