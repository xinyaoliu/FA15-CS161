1. It can not decrypt the same message we encrypted. 

It happens because if m is bigger than n, when decrypt the message, m^ed % n = m % n, but m is bigger than n, so the final answer should be other numbers instead of m, which leads to a different message other than m. 

Cyptosystems uses hash functions(MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 SHA-3, etc) to deal with large documents  which m > n.

2. The cipher texts are exactly the same. 

We can assume there is a "man in the middle". Every time we encrypt and send the same message, the m^e remains the same. Under the case that only encrypting one of two messages:"0" or "1“(boolean), if the key stays the same, the attacker could get to know m^e(mod n) of “1” and “0”. 

Since n, e, m, m^e are known, then the attacker can get d by using the same algorithm of breaking discrete logarithm, since we know that discrete log problem is breakable.

In this way, the attacker can figure out private key by using the datas he intercepted. And thus 
later when we encrypt different messages, the attacker can still decrypt it.
